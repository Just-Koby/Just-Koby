‚Ä¢ Please call me Koby or Coby, I use he/him pronouns.

‚Ä¢ If we haven't talked in a while i can get pretty distant towards you, or it could be i don't exactly know what to talk about. 

‚Ä¢ Always W2i, I prefer it that way because at least i get to know you before you sit with me, I also prefer to talk in whisper rather than public chat.

‚Ä¢ Do not flirt with me or say anything inappropriate. I will block you if you don't listen to my warning.

‚Ä¢ Important info: If you see this github in my profile in ponytown please whisper to me first before interacting, it could mean I'm vulnerable at the moment and I would appreciate it if you give me some space. 


# Other info !!

[Int]: Anyone can interact with as long as you are not weird :3

[**DNI**]: no need to to list it out, if I don't like you I will block you. (which I rarely do)

**End + Extra**

Github may still be a wip, if you want to know anything else about me then please don't be afraid to ask

**[üå∏]**

This github is for my fictkin Koby, when I shifted to him mentally I can have a switch in personalities and mindset, for example:While I do allow flirting or saying nsfw jokes, if I kinshift into Koby I will get uncomfortable.. Please respect my opinion. Call me Koby instead of Nagi when im using this github.

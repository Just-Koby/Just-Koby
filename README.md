  ![Untitled166](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97a8f1df-be0f-45e0-9d57-db655d7a2251)
• Please call me Koby or Coby, I use he/him pronouns.

• If we haven't talked in a while i can get pretty distant towards you, or it could be i don't exactly know what to talk about. 

• PLEASE Iwc, I get very nervous around people I don't know. I'm also kind of sensitive to insults even if they are a joke, kind of.

• Do not flirt with me or say any nasty things. I will block you if you don't listen to my warning.

• Important info: If you see this github in my profile in ponytown please whisper to me first before interacting, it could mean I'm vulnerable at the moment and I would appreciate it if you give me some space.
